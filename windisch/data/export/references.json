At the pilot scale, the RFB is introduced in the gasification chamber by means of a screw feeder and is converted at an average temperature of 785 \u00b0C in a bubbling fluidized bed reactor of 80 kWth, operated at atmospheric pressure and under auto-thermal regime, thus, direct gasification using atmospheric air.

It is a facility integrated in a synthetic fuel production chain, so a certain amount of the needed steam heat (used to regenerate the sorbent) can come from excess heat generated by the synfuel conversion process, the rest being complemented by a dedicated source. In Meunier et al. 2020, 26% comes from excess heat generated by the methanol production process. In Davil\u00e0, Sacchi and Pizool, 2023, close to 30% of the heat need comes from the cement kiln. We use the latter. To be changed according to needs. Also, there is no need for water, as it is provided by the methanol production process as well. CO2 chemical absorption-regeneration process using amines as scrubbing solvent. The amine solution used for this absorption was an aqueous solution of monoethanolamine (MEA) in a mass concentration of 30 wt.%, widely studied and considered as a benchmark for industrial CO2 capture applications. The CO2 is pre-compressed at 2 bar before storage. 10% of the CO2 is released back into the atmosphere (because the CO2 absoprtion rate is only 90%). The original publication considers the MEA makeup to be 1 kg per ton captured CO2 to compensate the losses due to the thermal degradation of the amine only, as the evaporation of the amine in the absorber is prevented by a flash tank. We correct this value to 4 kg, to algin with other point source capture and DAC datasets. The rate of fossil vs. biogenic CO2 received from the cement plant need to be reflected in this dataset in two places: at the leakage level, but also at the storage level. At the storage level, we only indicate biogenic CO2.

After flue gas condensation, the cooled flue gas is fed into a reactor containing a 30% MEA solution, which absorbs around 85\u201390% of the CO2, typically at 25 \u00b0C\u201350 \u00b0C at 1 bar. The process is exothermic. The CO2-rich solution is heated afterwards to 100\u2013140 \u00b0C, and in a stripper at 1\u20132 bars the CO2 desorbs from the MEA and leaves saturated with water vapour. The water is then condensed from the CO2 stream, and the CO2 is compressed to around 150 bar for transporting in pipes or a lower pressure for local tank storage and shipment by truck. The recovered MEA is reused in the plant (Pour et al., 2018). About 4 kg of MEA is used per tonne of CO2, due to degradation (releasing around 0.1 kg NH3 per tonne CO2 captured), the formation of heat-stable salts and losses as vapour and aerosols during stripping (the latter is around 0.01 kg per tonne of CO2 captured). NaOH is added in the stripping step at an amount of 0.1 kg per tonne CO2 captured. Around 4 kg of solid waste is generated per tonne of CO2 captured; this waste is disregarded. The MEA CC process also reduces the content of other pollutants in the flue gas, the extent of which depends on whether flue gas condensation is already in place or is introduced as part of the CO2 capture system. SOx, HCl, particulate matter and heavy metals are reduced to very low levels by flue gas condensation and subsequent CC. The level of NH3 increases in the flue gas after CC because of degradation of MEA. This is not included here. In the publication, a scenario where 90% of the needed heat comes from recovered heat from the MSWI plant. It is assumed here. However, 40% of the 90% is lost and cannot be redistructed to the district heating system afterwards. We also include this penalty here.

Looking at the material composition of different car models three years apart, (Hottle et al. 2017) show that steel is in fact increasingly replaced by a combination of both aluminium and AHSS. However, they also show that the use of AHSS is generally preferred to aluminium as it allows greater mass reduction at a lower cost. Hence, we will consider that, for a given mass reduction to achieve, two-third comes from using AHSS, and one third comes from using aluminium. This means that one kilogram of mass reduction is achieved by replacing 3.57 kilogram of steel by: 1.76 kilogram of AHSS and 0.8 kilogram of aluminium.", "source": ""}, "hydrogen production, gaseous, 1 bar, from SOEC electrolysis, from grid electricity": {"comment": "1 kg H2 produced using a SOEC electrolyzer.

Lifetime of 7-8 years per single stack, @ 8000 hours/year. Iridium mining process is NOT from ecoinvent. Produced amount of H2 over 20 years: 2964315.35 kg. According to a study called IndWEDe, it is assumed that the stacks are replaced 3 times during the 20 years lifespan, based on the 2030\u2019s scenario for 1\u202fMW systems which predicts a lifetime of 50,000\u202fh or more for the stacks of the different water electrolysis technologies. In comparison to AEC electrolyzers, PEMEC electrolyzers are less mature. Furthermore, the PEMEC technology is commercially available and operates with a similar system efficiency as the AEC technology. However, the current density and the gas purity are higher with values in between 0.6\u20132.0\u202fA/cm2 and > 99.99%, respectively. Besides this, the operating pressure (below 200\u202fbar) is significantly higher in comparison to AEC systems, while the operating temperature (50\u202f\u00b0C to 80\u202f\u00b0C) and the system energy (4.2\u20136.6\u202fkWh/m3H2) are similar to AEC systems.

CO2 coming from the CO2 separation unit is fed at 2 bar with hydrogen coming at 30 bar, both at 25\u00b0C. The hydrogen required for the conversion of CO2 into methanol has been calculated considering a stoichiometric inlet H2:CO2 feed ratio of 3. Hydrogen is compressed to 80 bar in a single stage, while CO2 is compressed to the same pressure in a series of four compressors intercooled to 128\u00b0C so that the recovered heat is provided to the reboiler of the stripper column from the CO2 capture unit for heat integration. CO2 and hydrogen are then mixed with the recycle stream derived from flash and preheated to 250\u00b0C before feeding the adiabatic reactor where the methanol reactions occur. This adiabatic reactor is filled with 156 tons of a commercial CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst. Lifetime of catalyst: 3 years. The product stream leaves the reactor at 314\u00b0C and is then thermally integrated by passing through a first heat exchanger to preheat the inlet gases of the reactor and reducing its temperature to 141\u00b0C. A heat exchanger cools then the stream to 112\u00b0C and the heat recovered is provided to the reboiler of the CO2 capture unit. The stream is further cooled in another heat exchanger to FULLY provide the heat required by the distillation column for the water-methanol separation. The product stream is then further cooled in two heat exchangers to respectively preheat the liquid stream inlet of the distillation column and the unreacted gases recycled to the adiabatic reactor. At this point, the temperature of the product stream is 63\u00b0C and a cooler is required to cool it down to 40\u00b0C to be fed to a flash tank for the separation of the gaseous and liquid phase of the stream. The pressure of the flash tank has been set to 75 bar to consider the pressure drop occurring along the line. The unreacted gases are then recycled to the inlet of the adiabatic reactor but a fraction of them are purged to prevent the accumulation of inert gases and by-products in the reaction loop. The water-methanol liquid mixture leaving the flash tank is then expanded to 1 bar and preheated to 90\u00b0C before being sent to the distillation column. The features of the distillation column depend on the desired purity/grade. Thus, to reach the design specifications of methanol and water purities, pure liquid methanol (99.1 wt.%) is produced at 1 bar and 20\u00b0C at the head of the distillation column, where pure water (99.99 wt.%) is recovered at 1 bar and 100\u00b0C at its bottom.  The rate of fossil vs. biogenic CO2 received from the cement plant need to be reflected in this dataset in two places: at the leakage level, but also at the storage level. At the storage level, we only indicate biogenic CO2. By default, we asusme 20% of the CO2 emissions are biogenic.", "source": "Alternative production of methanol from industrial CO2.

Under air oxidation, the PAN raw felt is treated at 300 \u00b0C for about one hour. The goal is to transform the felt into an infusible form by stretching and cyclizing the fibres. The heat input of the oxidation process is calculated by means of the heat capacity of polyacrylonitrile.
